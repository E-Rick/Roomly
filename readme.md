# Roomly

Roomly is a RESTful fullstack web app, inspired by other leading rental companies such as Airbnb, that I created to flex my fullstack development skills in MongoDB, ES6, Express, Node.js, and responsive web design. Roomly functions as an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent our their homes/rooms with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale.
