# Roomly

Roomly is a RESTful fullstack web app inspired by Airbnb that I created to develop my fullstack development skills using the NEMO stack (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Other Stuff). Roomly functions as an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent our their homes/rooms with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale.

## Setup Up

To run this project, install the latest version of MongoDB and make sure all the dependencies are installed using npm, then run
